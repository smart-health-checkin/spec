# SMART Health Check-in over `org-iso-mdoc` — direct profile

> **Archived, pre-1.0.** Kept for history; names, paths, and details here may not match the 1.0 spec or current code.

## TL;DR

Skip OID4VP entirely. The DC API already gives us:

- **Verifier origin authentication** — the browser hands the wallet
  `callingAppInfo.origin`. That string is a real-world trust anchor (it's the
  origin in the URL bar) and we display it to the user.
- **Request integrity** — the mdoc SessionTranscript binds `(origin, nonce, RP
  HPKE pubkey)` into every signature.
- **Response confidentiality + integrity** — HPKE-sealed DeviceResponse, AAD-bound
  to the SessionTranscript, only openable by the verifier page that holds the
  ephemeral private key.

So we don't need:

- `well_known:` discovery / metadata fetch
- Signed Request Object JWTs / `jwks_uri` / signature verification
- A second ephemeral key for `client_metadata.jwks` (one HPKE key for transport
  is enough)
- JWE encryption of the inner payload
- `nonce` / `state` plumbing at the application layer (the mdoc nonce already
  binds the request)
- `response_uri`, `direct_post.jwt`, `response_code`, completion modes — none
  apply when the DC API is the channel

What we do need: a clean **request JSON** and a clean **response JSON**, each
carried as a `tstr` inside the mdoc envelope. That's it.

The legacy browser-shim flow with OID4VP/relay is archived under
`archive/legacy-oid4vp/`. It is historical context only for this project.

## Request shape (verifier → wallet)

A single JSON object, placed in the ItemsRequest's `requestInfo` map under the
key `smart_health_checkin`, encoded as a CBOR text string (we don't bother with
nested CBOR maps — JSON-in-tstr is simpler and parses with serde_json / cJSON):

```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "items": [
    { "id": "insurance",
      "profile": "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/insurance-card/StructureDefinition/C4DIC-Coverage",
      "required": true },

    { "id": "patient",
      "profile": "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient" },

    { "id": "vaccinations",
      "profile": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Immunization",
      "signing": ["shc_v1", "none"] },

    { "id": "intake",
      "questionnaire": {
        "resourceType": "Questionnaire",
        "title": "Migraine Check-in",
        "item": [ /* full FHIR Questionnaire, possibly multi-KB */ ]
      } }
  ]
}
```

Per-item fields:

| Field | Required | Notes |
| ----- | -------- | ----- |
| `id` | yes | Verifier-defined opaque string. Reused as the key in the response's `answers` map. |
| `profile` | mut.excl. | FHIR StructureDefinition canonical URL — wallet returns matching FHIR resources. |
| `questionnaire` | mut.excl. | Inline FHIR Questionnaire JSON — wallet renders it and returns a QuestionnaireResponse. |
| `questionnaireUrl` | mut.excl. | URL ref to a Questionnaire — wallet fetches, renders, returns. |
| `required` | optional | Default `false`. UX hint only; wallet may still allow user to skip. |
| `signing` | optional | Array of acceptable signing strategies; values from `["none", "shc_v1", "shc_v2"]`. Default `["none"]` (any). |
| `description` | optional | Human-readable explanation surfaced in consent UI. |

Exactly one of `profile` / `questionnaire` / `questionnaireUrl` per item.

The full request object can be tens of KB when Questionnaires are inlined. CBOR
text strings have no documented cap; we self-impose ~256 KB and prefer
`questionnaireUrl` for anything bigger.

## Response shape (wallet → verifier)

A single JSON object, placed as the `elementValue` of the lone IssuerSignedItem
in the DeviceResponse, also encoded as a CBOR text string:

```json
{
  "type": "smart-health-checkin-response",
  "version": "1",
  "requestId": "demo-request",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "id": "a1",
      "mediaType": "application/fhir+json",
      "fhirVersion": "4.0.1",
      "fulfills": ["insurance"],
      "value": { "resourceType": "Coverage", "id": "...", "subscriberId": "..." }
    },

    {
      "id": "a2",
      "mediaType": "application/fhir+json",
      "fhirVersion": "4.0.1",
      "fulfills": ["patient"],
      "value": { "resourceType": "Patient", "id": "...", "name": [...] }
    },

    {
      "id": "a3",
      "mediaType": "application/smart-health-card",
      "fulfills": ["vaccinations"],
      "value": { "verifiableCredential": ["eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6...."] }
    },

    {
      "id": "a4",
      "mediaType": "application/fhir+json",
      "fhirVersion": "4.0.1",
      "fulfills": ["intake"],
      "value": {
        "resourceType": "QuestionnaireResponse",
        "questionnaire": "<url-or-id>",
        "item": [ /* user's answers */ ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "requestStatus": [
    { "item": "insurance", "status": "fulfilled" },
    { "item": "patient", "status": "fulfilled" },
    { "item": "vaccinations", "status": "fulfilled" },
    { "item": "intake", "status": "fulfilled" }
  ]
}
```

Two-part structure exactly as you described:

- **`artifacts`** — flat de-duplicated list. `id` is wallet-generated and scoped
  to this response. Artifacts are typed by `mediaType`; raw FHIR JSON uses
  `mediaType: "application/fhir+json"` plus `fhirVersion`, and the FHIR payload
  itself declares `value.resourceType`.
- **`requestStatus`** — one status per requested item, including declined,
  unavailable, unsupported, or error outcomes. `artifact.fulfills` links shared
  artifacts back to the request item ids they satisfy.

If a Questionnaire was filled, return its `QuestionnaireResponse` as a normal
FHIR JSON artifact. The artifact does not need a special questionnaire-response
type; `value.resourceType` already says `"QuestionnaireResponse"`.

## Why this is enough

Trust model walked through:

| Concern | How it's handled |
| ------- | --------------- |
| "Is this verifier really clinic.example.com?" | Browser sets `callingAppInfo.origin`. Wallet shows the origin in the consent UI. User decides. |
| "Is the response bound to this verifier session?" | mdoc SessionTranscript = (origin, nonce, RP HPKE pubkey). Wallet's DeviceAuth signs over it and HPKE uses it as AAD. The SMART request JSON is delivered by the browser/Credential Manager local channel; it is not separately JWT-signed. |
| "Can anyone else read the response?" | HPKE-sealed under the RP's ephemeral pubkey. Only the verifier page that generated the keypair can open it. |
| "Did the wallet really send this exact response?" | DeviceAuth COSE_Sign1 over the SessionTranscript. Self-signed (we explicitly don't care about issuer trust); MSO digests prevent in-flight modification. |
| "Is the response replay-resistant?" | Per-request nonce in the SessionTranscript; HPKE encapsulation is unique per response. |

That's the same set of guarantees the OID4VP wrapping was providing. We just
get them from the underlying DC API + ISO mdoc + HPKE machinery instead of
duplicating them at the application layer.

## What the wallet does, end to end

1. Matcher sees `docType == "org.smarthealthit.checkin"` → surfaces an entry.
2. User taps. Handler activity launches.
3. Handler decodes the CBOR `DeviceRequest`, pulls
   `requestInfo.smart_health_checkin` (a tstr) → `JSON.parse` → request object.
4. UI: shows `callingAppInfo.origin` prominently as the verifier identity.
   For each `items[i]`:
   - Shows `description` (if any) and the inferred kind ("Coverage from your
     insurer", "Demographics", "Questionnaire: Migraine Check-in", etc.)
   - For `profile`: shows matching local FHIR resources, lets user pick.
   - For `questionnaire` / `questionnaireUrl`: renders the form, lets user fill
     it (auto-pre-filling from local FHIR data where possible).
5. User confirms. Wallet builds the response JSON above.
6. Wallet builds the DeviceResponse:
   - `docType`: `"org.smarthealthit.checkin"`
   - One IssuerSignedItem with
     `elementIdentifier = "smart_health_checkin_response"`,
     `elementValue = <response JSON as tstr>`
   - Self-signed MSO + DeviceAuth signature over the SessionTranscript.
7. HPKE-seals the DeviceResponse under the RP's pubkey, AAD =
   SessionTranscript.
8. Returns `{"protocol":"org-iso-mdoc","data":"<base64url(sealed)>"}` via
   `PendingIntentHandler.setGetCredentialResponse`.

## What the verifier does, end to end

1. `await navigator.credentials.get(...)` → `{ protocol, data }`.
2. `data` → base64url-decode → HPKE-open with own private key + computed
   SessionTranscript → DeviceResponse CBOR.
3. CBOR-decode → walk to the lone IssuerSignedItem → `JSON.parse` its
   `elementValue` → response object.
4. Use `answers` to route artifacts back to the originating UI flows.

No JWE library required. No JWT verification required. No metadata fetch. The
verifier-side code is ~50 lines.
