# smart-health-checkin-mdoc

A **SMART Health Check-in** prototype: a transport-neutral check-in
request/response model bound to the W3C Digital Credentials API over direct
`org-iso-mdoc`. The repo ships an end-to-end demo — Android wallet, web
verifier — driven by checked-in byte
fixtures captured from a real Chrome/Android session and exercised by Android,
TypeScript, and Python test suites that validate request parsing, HPKE-opened
response bytes, MSO digest binding, and COSE signatures.

SMART Health Check-in 1.0 is intentionally two-layered: the clinical
request/response JSON model plus the same-device direct `org-iso-mdoc`
presentation flow. QR codes, kiosks, desktop/staff handoffs, relays, and
completion screens in this repo are deployment/demo UX around that same-device
flow, not standardized SMART Health Check-in 1.0 pointer, relay, submission, or
completion protocols.

## Quickstart

```sh
cd rp-web && bun install && cd ..
scripts/serve-pages.sh         # builds _site, serves http://localhost:3015/
```

The preview serves the same `_site` artifact GitHub Pages deploys. Page links
are relative so the artifact works at either a domain root or a Pages subpath.

## Where to start

For a fresh pickup, in order:

1. The deployed site (or the local preview above).
2. [`spec.md`](spec.md) — the assembled SMART Health Check-in 1.0 draft
   spec: §§5-6 define the normative TypeScript/JSDoc clinical request/response
   model, §8 defines the same-device `org-iso-mdoc` presentation flow, and
   Appendix A is a diagnostic bridge for the same-device byte boundaries.

Research notes and archive material under `docs/research/` and
`docs/archive/` are historical and not part of the public pickup path.

## Major components

- **SMART Health Check-in protocol.** A transport-neutral JSON
  request/response model used by every component. Defined in [`spec.md`](spec.md)
  §§5-6 by normative TypeScript interfaces and JSDoc comments.

- **`org-iso-mdoc` wire profile.** The active binding to the W3C Digital
  Credentials API: the SMART request rides inside
  `ItemsRequest.requestInfo["org.smarthealthit.checkin.request"]` and the
  SMART response comes back in the stable mdoc element
  `smart_health_checkin_response`. Specified in [`spec.md`](spec.md) §8,
  with a non-normative diagnostic bridge in Appendix A. Byte ladders, schemas,
  fixtures, and tutorials are companion material in this repository.

- **TypeScript verifier SDK.** Framework-neutral SMART request/response
  validation, browser DC API verifier flow, verifier-authority seam, and
  deployment-handoff helpers used by the kiosk demo. Optional React bindings ship alongside.
  Start at [`rp-web/src/sdk/README.md`](rp-web/src/sdk/README.md) and
  [`rp-web/src/sdk/react.README.md`](rp-web/src/sdk/react.README.md).

- **Demos.** The same-device check-in, the kiosk hand-off, and the demo web
  wallet live on [smart-health-checkin.org](https://smart-health-checkin.org/)
  and are built from the `checkin-client` repo; the apps that used to live
  under `rp-web/` were retired in favour of them.
- **Android wallet.** Modular Gradle project under
  [`wallet-android/`](wallet-android/README.md) that registers credentials
  with Credential Manager and answers direct mdoc requests carrying SMART
  Health Check-in payloads, including the Rust WASM matcher
  ([`wallet-android/app/matcher-rs/README.md`](wallet-android/app/matcher-rs/README.md)).

- **Web-wallet shim (side surface, demo).** A second mediator path that uses
  explicit web-wallet credential handles backed by a script-opened wallet
  tab/window, while
  keeping the wire format identical to the platform DC API flow. It does not
  patch `navigator.credentials.get`; verifier UI can compose these handles with
  the app-owned Platform Wallet path when configured.
  Lives in [`rp-web/src/sdk-web-wallet/`](rp-web/src/sdk-web-wallet/README.md)
  with a reference wallet app under `rp-web/src/wallet-app/`. Not part of the
  v1.0 SMART Health Check-in protocol; not re-exported from the SDK
  barrel.

- **Public site.** Landing page and HTML explainers in
  [`site/`](site/): the SMART model explainer, the kiosk handoff demo
  explainer, and a byte-level wire-protocol inspector that fetches the same
  checked-in fixtures the test suites use.

- **Fixtures and tools.** [`fixtures/`](fixtures/) holds normalized,
  checked-in byte captures shared across every language's tests;
  [`tools/`](tools/) collects developer-only capture scripts,
  fixture-generation utilities, and diagnostic matchers.

## GitHub Pages deployment

[`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) on
pushes to `main` and on manual workflow dispatch.
